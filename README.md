# pymaceuticals-challenge
## Overview 
### In this project we used data extracted from a study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc. a pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer treatment. The study investigates several potential therapies for squamous cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer, on humanized mice. The objective of this project is to successfully use Matplotlib to visualize and analyze the dataset. 
## Important Findings 
* Ramicane was the most effective drug treatment plan, as it displayed the smallest tumor value.
* Capomulin was the second most effective drug treatment plan, with a slight difference from Ramicane.
* The study mitigated confounding variables, as the sex of the mice was evenly split in the analysis of drug efficacy.
* Conducting studies such as these and utilizing Matplotlib are imperative to our understanding, and could help decision makers create better treatment plans and respond to disease more efficiently.
